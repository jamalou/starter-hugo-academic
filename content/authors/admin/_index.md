Gait 3 is a tri-modal: Event-based, RGB, and Thermal database for gait recognition (Identifying people by analysis of the way they walk). This database is the first that contains event-camera acquisition, simultaneously with conventional RGB and thermal videos. 

The database was collected from 56 subjects and contains recordings of people in three variations: normal walking, quick walking, and walking with a backpack. For each variation, the subject is recorded twice, walking from left to right and walking from right to left.
