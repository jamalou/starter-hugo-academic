The data collection took place in a controlled environment.
Videos were recorded in an empty room equipped with two
lightings in addition to the room lights. The cameras were put
about 1 meter from the ground and facing perpendicularly to
the background (the wall of the room) at about 6 meters from
it. Fig. 1 shows an example of an individual from our database,
recorded simultaneously with an event-based camera, RGB
camera, and thermal camera.
