Event cameras are a new family of vision sensors that differ
completely from conventional cameras: instead of capturing
images at a fixed rate, they asynchronously measure per-pixel
brightness changes and output the event stream as a sequence
of tuples \[t, x, y, p] that encode the time t, pixel coordinates
(x, y) and p the sign of the brightness changes.
