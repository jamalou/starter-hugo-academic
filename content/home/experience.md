Gait is an emergent biometric aimed essentially to recognize people by the way they walk, We people often feel that they can identify a familiar person from a distance simply by recognizing the way the person walks.

A unique advantage of gait is that it is non-invasive. It does not require the personâ€™s cooperation and offers potential for recognition at a distance, at low resolution, or when other biometrics might not be perceivable.

It received lots of interest over the last twenty years, and it has seen considerable progress using different kinds of sensors. In our work, we decided to use a new sensor called an event-based camera.
